## 1. Overview

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Tags always represent the version of the Build Patch Tool**

The image is based off of [`debian:stable-slim`](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian) with a few caveats.

- A custom user (`bpt:bpt`) has been added since the binary expects a non-root user to execute it.
- To make it usable within CI/CD environments, where other software might be needed, the above mentioned user can execute `sudo` without a password.
- The package `xdg-user-dirs` has been installed since the binary expects it to be installed and exits with a non-zero exit code if it's not present.
- A binary wrapper script has been added with which the binary can be called from everywhere: `bpt -help`.

**Pull Image**

```bash
docker pull mrbandler/bpt:latest
